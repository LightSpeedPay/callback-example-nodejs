# Callback Server

This project sets up a basic server using Express.js to handle callbacks with authentication. It is configured to listen for incoming HTTP requests and validates authorization tokens for protected endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/callback-server.git
    cd callback-server
    ```

2. Install the necessary packages:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required for basic operation. However, you can customize the token and port in the source code as needed.

## Running the Server

Start the server with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```

The server will be available at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/). The server listens on port 5000 by default.

## Usage

### Protected Route

#### POST /callback

This is a protected route that requires a valid authorization token.

To access the protected route, include an authorization header with your request:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/callback -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' -d '{"data":"value"}'
```

**Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your valid token to test the authentication.**
